## Contributing Guidelines

- Issues will be assigned on a _first come, first serve_ basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- Preferably, you cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue, describing in details your improvement. This will help others to analyze your contribution.
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR.
- If you have no idea how to make contribution, please do refer to [this link](https://github.com/prasadvpatil/Data-Structure-Algorithms/blob/master/Contribution.md)

Make sure your code works before submitting it :D

### Where to upload the files

**PLEASE READ THIS**

- Your files should be uploaded directly into the corresponding folder.
- **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so**.
- Also, be polite with the reviewer - they will be ALWAYS polite to you.
